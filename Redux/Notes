We can use redux any where ,i can use react with angular with vue as well but mostly it is used with React.

Redux is a container where we can store our whole application data kind of array, 

we actually called is state management.
state mean sara ka sara data ek jagah pe save karna.

Redux doesnot belong to component and state.

Redux Architecture
------------------
4 main pillars of Redux Architecture
1. View
2. Action
3. Reducer
4. Store

View is what we can see for example Button, Radio Buttons, checkBox etc etc.

Action : Collect Data from Component or API
for example Login so to login we need some data 
so that we can login.


Reducer: Now what reducer will do to receive the data from the action and send it to store. it also filters the data.

Store: Store contain the state of complete application.
state mean pura ka pura data.
