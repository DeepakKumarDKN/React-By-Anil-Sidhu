NPM: Node Package Manager, and it manages all the packages which ae inside the node modules.
If we want to install any package then we can write : npm install package-name
here it will not download anything the installation will happen automatically.


if we want to create any file name then we can do it by writting :- Example.js  
the first letter will always be Capital.

File and Folder Structure
-------------------------
1.) package.json : 
----------------
anything which are we installing any  all we will get to know inside he package.json. 
if somebody wants to know we are working on which we are working right now 

then we can go inside the package.json and there we can get to know the version its one of the imporatant file. 



2.) package-lock.json
---------------------
it keeps the history of the packages for Example: 

"node_modules/@babel/compat-data": {
    "version": "7.22.5",
    "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@babe   compat-data/-/compat-data-7.22.5.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-4J   YuIaYqKnDDz892kPIledykKg12Aw1PYX5  TY28anJtacvM1Rrr8wbieB9GfEJwlzqT0hUEao0CxEebiD    =",
    "engines": {
        "node": ">=6.9.0"
}

So this is a package  it keeps all the indo such as 
    . version name
    . resolved (from where it is installed)
    . integrity


so the package.json keep the details of the application 

and the package-lock.json keeps the history of the packages in detail.

3.) .gitignore
---------------
it will ignore those files which we dont want to commit
