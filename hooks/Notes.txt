If we want to use hooks then it can be done inside the functional Components

When we are talking about classComponents then it does have a lot of inbuilt featue like  ,
state, life cycle methods and pue components, But in functional component
we will not get all these inbuilt features , but still we can use them with 
the help of hooks 



useState is a hook with the help of which we can create a hook
wherever you see use is written and before use something like State,Effect etc ‚è≤
thes are called hooks.
